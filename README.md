# Chat Drafts

A minimalist iOS app for preparing lengthy chat messages away from typing indicators. Use the sharesheet to send off your message when ready!

The goal of this project is to identify the efficacy of using AI to create and launch an iOS application from scratch, and then iterate upon it. If successful, the project provides an example to Product and Engineering teams on how AI could speed up the software development lifecycle. Leveraging these sort of tools can provide interactive proof of concepts to stakeholders in minutes rather than sprints. In some cases, AI generated elements may also provide an initial starting point for Engineering teams to iterate upon. While this intro was written by Edward Hallam, all remaining content and code has been authored by Cursor AI.
